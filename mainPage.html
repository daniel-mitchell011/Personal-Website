                         &nbsp;&nbsp;I'm Daniel, and welcome to my website. In here, you'll find samples of some of my work both personal and from my school days.
                         My GitHub page has some but not all of my work since some of the projects were from fixed assignments from my university (primarily Mines) that 
                         would be spoiling solutions to the problems they provide if I posted them. My expertise is primarily in C++/Python; however, 
                         I've had some fun learning HTML/CSS/JavaScript over the summer.
                         
                           
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         &nbsp;&nbsp;My main interest lately has been in Rust, and I am looking to contribute to open-source projects.
                         I am also interested in React.js and plan to update this site by rewriting it with React.
