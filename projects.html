            This is an Android app that I wrote in Kotlin. It allows users to create 
            and review flash cards that they create. It uses a primitive SRS algorithm
            to aid in reviewing the cards.

            This is an implementation of a Unix-style shell that I wrote. It allows the user to run most commands

            successfully and the frown that it failed.
